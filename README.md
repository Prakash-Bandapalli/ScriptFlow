## 🧠 System Architecture
Four collaborative agents power the magic:

| Agent            | Role                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **🎭 Classifier** | Maps input topics to genres + fetches pattern databases              |
| **✍️ Writer**     | Crafts drafts using genre patterns + iterative feedback              |
| **✅ Validator**  | Scores scripts on 10+ engagement metrics (fiercely critical!)        |
| **📝 Summarizer** | Translates validator critiques into actionable writing prompts       |
